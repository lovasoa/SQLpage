            policy to your pages, and set any HTTP header, among other things.
        If you are a beginner, you probably don''t need this component.
        HTTP headers are additional pieces of information sent with responses to web requests
            that provide instructions or metadata about the data being sent â€” for example,
            setting cache control directives to control caching behavior
            or specifying the content type of a response.
        When used, this component has to be the first component in the page, because once the
            page is sent to the browser, it is too late to change the headers.
        Any valid HTTP header name can be used as a top-level parameter for this component.
        The examples shown here are just that, examples; and you can create any custom header
            if needed simply by declaring it.
        For example, the htmx javascript library uses an `HX-Redirect` header to prompt client-side redirects.
        Note: if your header has hyphens in its name, you''ll need to enclose it (standard SQL uses double quotes).',
