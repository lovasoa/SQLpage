# CHANGELOG.md

## 0.24.0 (2024-06-23)
 - in the form component, searchable `select` fields now support more than 50 options. They used to display only the first 50 options. 
   - ![screenshot](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/40571d08-d058-45a8-83ef-91fa134f7ce2)
 - map component
   - automatically center the map on the contents when no top-level latitude and longitude properties are provided even when the map contains geojson data.
   - allow using `FALSE as tile_source` to completely remove the base map. This makes the map component useful to display even non-geographical geometric data.
 - Fix a bug that occured when no `database_url` was provided in the configuration file. SQLPage would generate an incorrect default SQLite database URL.
 - Add a new `background_color` attribute to the [card](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=card#component) component to set the background color of the card.
   - ![cards with color backgrounds](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/d925d77c-e1f6-490f-8fb4-cdcc4418233f) 
 - new handlebars helper for [custom components](https://sql.ophir.dev/custom_components.sql): `{{app_config 'property'}}` to access the configuration object from the handlebars template.
 - Prevent form validation and give a helpful error message when an user tries to submit a form with a file upload field that is above the maximum file size.
   - ![file upload too large](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/1c684d33-49bd-4e49-9ee0-ed3f0d454ced)
 - Fix a bug in [`sqlpage.read_file_as_data_url`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=read_file_as_data_url#function) where it would truncate the mime subtype of the file. This would cause the browser to refuse to display SVG files, for instance.
 - Avoid vertical scrolling caused by the footer even when the page content is short.
 - Add a new `compact` attribute to the [list](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=list#component), allowing to display more items in a list without taking up too much space. Great for displaying long lists of items.
   - ![compact list screenshot](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/41302807-c6e4-40a0-9486-bfd0ceae1537)
 - Add property `narrow` to the [button](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=button#component) component to make the button narrower. Ideal for buttons with icons.
   - ![icon buttons](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/7fcc049e-6012-40c1-a8ee-714ce70a8763)
 - new `tooltip` property in the datagrid component.
    - ![datagrid tooltip](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/81b94d92-1bca-4ffe-9056-c30d6845dcc6)
 - datagrids are now slightly more compact, with less padding and less space taken by each item.
 - fix a bug in the [card](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=card#component) component where the icon would sometimes overflow the card's text content.
 - new `image` property in the [button](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=button#component) component to display a small image inside a button.
   - ![image button](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/cdfa0709-1b00-4779-92cb-dc6f3e78c1a8)
 - In the `shell` component
   - allow easily creating complex menus even in SQLite:
      ```sql
      select 'shell' as component, 'My Website' as title, '{"title":"About","submenu":[{"link":"/x.sql","title":"X"},{"link":"/y.sql","title":"Y"}]}' as menu_item;
        ```
   - allow easily creating optional menu items that are only displayed in some conditions:
      ```sql
      select 'shell' as component, 'My Website' as title, CASE WHEN $role = 'admin' THEN 'Admin' END as menu_item;
    - Add the ability to use local Woff2 fonts in the [shell](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=shell#component) component. This is useful to use custom fonts in your website, without depending on google fonts (and disclosing your users' IP addresses to google).
    - Add a `fixed_top_menu` attribute to make the top menu sticky. This is useful to keep the menu visible even when the user scrolls down the page.
      - ![a fixed top menu](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/65fe3a41-faee-45e6-9dfc-d81eca043f45)
 - Add a `wrap` attribute to the `list` component to wrap items on multiple lines when they are too long.
 - New `max_pending_rows` [configuration option](https://sql.ophir.dev/configuration.md) to limit the number of messages that can be sent to the client before they are read. Usefule when sending large amounts of data to slow clients.
 - New `compress_responses` configuration option. Compression is still on by default, but can now be disabled to allow starting sending the page sooner. It's sometimes better to start displaying the shell immediateley and render components as soon as they are ready, even if that means transmitting more data over the wire.
 - Update sqlite to v3.46: https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_46_0.html
   -  major upgrades to PRAGMA optimize, making it smarter and more efficient on large databases
   -  enhancements to [date and time functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html), including easy week-of-year calculations
   -  support for underscores in numeric literals. Write `1_234_567` instead of `1234567` 
   -  new [`json_pretty()`](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html) function 
 - Faster initial page load. SQLPage used to wait for the first component to be rendered before sending the shell to the client. We now send the shell immediately, and the first component as soon as it is ready. This can make the initial page load faster, especially when the first component requires a long computation on the database side.
 - Include a default favicon when none is specified in the shell component. This fixes the `Unable to read file "favicon.ico"` error message that would appear in the logs by default.
   - ![favicon](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/cf48e271-2fe4-42da-b825-893cff3f95fb)

## 0.23.0 (2024-06-09)

 - fix a bug in the [csv](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=csv#component) component. The `separator` parameter now works as expected. This facilitates creating excel-compatible CSVs in european countries where excel expects the separator to be `;` instead of `,`.
 - new `tooltip` property in the button component.
 - New `search_value` property in the shell component.
 - Fixed a display issue in the hero component when the button text is long and the viewport is narrow.
 - reuse the existing opened database connection for the current query in `sqlpage.run_sql` instead of opening a new one. This makes it possible to create a temporary table in a file, and reuse it in an included script, create a SQL transaction that spans over multiple run_sql calls, and should generally make run_sql more performant.
 - Fixed a bug in the cookie component where removing a cookie from a subdirectory would not work.
 - [Updated SQL parser](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0470-2024-06-01). Fixes support for `AT TIME ZONE` in postgres. Fixes `GROUP_CONCAT()` in MySQL.
 - Add a new warning message in the logs when trying to use `SET $x = ` when there is already a form field named `x`.
 - **Empty Uploaded files**: when a form contains an optional file upload field, and the user does not upload a file, the field used to still be accessible to SQLPage file-related functions such as `sqlpage.uploaded_file_path` and `sqlpage.uploaded_file_mime_type`. This is now fixed, and these functions will return `NULL` when the user does not upload a file. `sqlpage.persist_uploaded_file` will not create an empty file in the target directory when the user does not upload a file, instead it will do nothing and return `NULL`.
 - In the [map](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=map#component) component, when top-level latitude and longitude properties are omitted, the map will now center on its markers. This makes it easier to create zoomed maps with a single marker.
 - In the [button](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=button#component) component, add a `download` property to make the button download a file when clicked, a `target` property to open the link in a new tab, and a `rel` property to prevent search engines from following the link.
 - New `timeout` option in the [sqlpage.fetch](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=fetch#function) function to set a timeout for the request. This is useful when working with slow or unreliable APIs, large payloads, or when you want to avoid waiting too long for a response.
 - In the [hero](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=hero#component) component, add a `poster` property to display a video poster image, a `loop` property to loop the video (useful for short animations), a `muted` property to mute the video, and a `nocontrols` property to hide video controls.
 - Fix a bug where icons would disappear when serving a SQLPage website from a subdirectory and not the root of the (sub)domain using the `site_prefix` configuration option.

## 0.22.0 (2024-05-29)
 -  **Important Security Fix:** The behavior of `SET $x` has been modified to match `SELECT $x`.
     - **Security Risk:** Previously, `SET $x` could be overwritten by a POST parameter named `x`.
     - **Solution:** Upgrade to SQLPage v0.22. If not possible, then update your application to use `SET :x` instead of `SET $x`.
     - For more information, see [GitHub Issue #342](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/342).
 -  **Deprecation Notice:** Reading POST variables using `$x`.
     - **New Standard:** Use `:x` for POST variables and `$x` for GET variables.
     - **Current Release Warning:** Using `$x` for POST variables will display a console warning: 
       ```
       Deprecation warning! $x was used to reference a form field value (a POST variable) instead of a URL parameter. This will stop working soon. Please use :x instead.
       ```
     - **Future Change:** `$x` will evaluate to `NULL` if no GET variable named `x` is present, regardless of any POST variables.
    - **Detection and Update:** Use provided warnings to find and update deprecated usages in your code.
    -  **Reminder about GET and POST Variables:**
       - **GET Variables:** Parameters included in the URL of an HTTP GET request, used to retrieve data. Example: `https://example.com/page?x=value`, where `x` is a GET variable.
       - **POST Variables:** Parameters included in the body of an HTTP POST request, used for form submissions. Example: the value entered by the user in a form field named `x`.
 - Two **backward-incompatible changes** in the [chart](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=chart#component) component's timeseries plotting feature (actioned with `TRUE as time`):
    -  when providing a number for the x value (time), it is now interpreted as a unix timestamp, in seconds (number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). It used to be interpreted as milliseconds. If you were using the `TRUE as time` syntax with integer values, you will need to divide your time values by 1000 to get the same result as before.
        - This change makes it easier to work with time series plots, as most databases return timestamps in seconds. For instance, in SQLite, you can store timestamps as integers with the [`unixepoch()`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html) function, and plot them directly in SQLPage.
    - when providing an ISO datetime string for the x value (time), without an explicit timezone, it is now interpreted and displayed in the local timezone of the user. It used to be interpreted as a local time, but displayed in UTC, which [was confusing](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/324). If you were using the `TRUE as time` syntax with naive datetime strings (without timezone information), you will need to convert your datetime strings to UTC on the database side if you want to keep the same behavior as before. As a side note, it is always recommended to store and query datetime strings with timezone information in the database, to avoid ambiguity.
      - This change is particularly useful in SQLite, which generates naive datetime strings by default. You should still store and query datetimes as unix timestamps when possible, to avoid ambiguity and reduce storage size.
 - When calling a file with [`sqlpage.run_sql`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=run_sql#function), the target file now has access to uploaded files.
 - New article by [Matthew Larkin](https://github.com/matthewlarkin) about [migrations](https://sql.ophir.dev/your-first-sql-website/migrations.sql).
 - Add a row-level `id` attribute to the button component.
 - Static assets (js, css, svg) needed to build SQLPage are now cached individually, and can be downloaded separately from the build process. This makes it easier to build SQLPage without internet access. If you use pre-built SQLPage binaries, this change does not affect you.
 - New `icon_after` row-level property in the button component to display an icon on the right of a button (after the text). Contributed by @amrutadotorg.
 - New demo example: [dark theme](./examples/light-dark-toggle/). Contributed by @lyderic.
 - Add the ability to [bind to a unix socket instead of a TCP port](https://sql.ophir.dev/your-first-sql-website/nginx.sql) for better performance on linux. Contributed by @vlasky.

## 0.21.0 (2024-05-19) 

 - `sqlpage.hash_password(NULL)` now returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error. This behavior was changed unintentionally in 0.20.5 and could have broken existing SQLPage websites.
 - The [dynamic](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=dynamic#component) component now supports multiple `properties` attributes. The following is now possible:
   ```sql
   select 'dynamic' as component, 
          '{ "component": "card", "title": "Hello" }' as properties,
          '{ "title": "World" }' as properties;
   ```
 - Casting values from one type to another using the `::` operator is only supported by PostgreSQL. SQLPage versions before 0.20.5 would silently convert all casts to the `CAST(... AS ...)` syntax, which is supported by all databases. Since 0.20.5, SQLPage started to respect the original `::` syntax, and pass it as-is to the database. This broke existing SQLPage websites that used the `::` syntax with databases other than PostgreSQL. For backward compatibility, this version of SQLPage re-establishes the previous behavior, converts `::` casts on non-PostgreSQL databases to the `CAST(... AS ...)` syntax, but will display a warning in the logs. 
    - In short, if you saw an error like `Error: unrecognized token ":"` after upgrading to 0.20.5, this version should fix it.
 - The `dynamic` component now properly displays error messages when its properties are invalid. There used to be a bug where errors would be silently ignored, making it hard to debug invalid dynamic components.
 - New [`sqlpage.request_method`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=request_method#function) function to get the HTTP method used to access the current page. This is useful to create pages that behave differently depending on whether they are accessed with a GET request (to display a form, for instance) or a POST request (to process the form).
 - include the trailing semicolon as a part of the SQL statement sent to the database. This doesn't change anything in most databases, but Microsoft SQL Server requires a trailing semicolon after certain statements, such as `MERGE`. Fixes [issue #318](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/318)
 - New `readonly` and `disabled` attributes in the [form](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=form#component) component to make form fields read-only or disabled. This is useful to prevent the user from changing some fields.
 - 36 new icons [(tabler icons 3.4)](https://tabler.io/icons/changelog)
 - Bug fixes in charts [(apexcharts.js v3.49.1)](https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js/releases)

## 0.20.5 (2024-05-07)

 - Searchable multi-valued selects in the form component
   - Fix missing visual indication of selected item in form dropdown fields. 
     - ![screenshot](https://github.com/tabler/tabler/assets/552629/a575db2f-e210-4984-a786-5727687ac037)
   - fix autofocus on select fields with dropdown
   - add *searchable* as an alias for *dropdown* in the form component
 - Added support for SSL client certificates in MySQL and Postgres
    - SSL client certificates are commonly used to secure connections to databases in cloud environments. To connect to a database that requires a client certificate, you can now use the ssl_cert and ssl_key connection options in the connection string. For example: postgres://user@host/db?ssl_cert=/path/to/client-cert.pem&ssl_key=/path/to/client-key.pem
 - The SQLPage function system was greatly improved
   - All the functions can now be freely combined and nested, without any limitation. No more `Expected a literal single quoted string.` errors when trying to nest functions.
   - The error messages when a function call is invalid were rewritten, to include more context, and provide suggestions on how to fix the error. This should make it easier get started with SQLPage functions.
   Error messages should always be clear and actionnable. If you encounter an error message you don't understand, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues) on the SQLPage repository.
   - Adding new functions is now easier, and the code is more maintainable. This should make it easier to contribute new functions to SQLPage. If you have an idea for a new function, feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the SQLPage repository. All sqlpage functions are defined in [`functions.rs`](./src/webserver/database/sqlpage_functions/functions.rs).
 - The `shell-empty` component (used to create pages without a shell) now supports the `html` attribute, to directly set the raw contents of the page. This is useful to advanced users who want to generate the page content directly in SQL, without using the SQLPage components. 
 - Updated sqlparser to [v0.46](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0460-2024-05-03)
   - The changes include support for DECLARE parsing and CONVERT styles in MSSQL, improved JSON access parsing and ?-based jsonb operators in Postgres, and `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY` support for MySQL.

## 0.20.4 (2024-04-23)

 - Improvements to the fetch function
   - Set a default [user-agent header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_header) when none is specified (`User-Agent: sqlpage`).
   - bundle root certificates with sqlpage so that we can always access HTTPS URLs even on outdated or stripped-down systems.
   - update our https library to the latest version everywhere, to avoid having to bundle two distinct versions of it.

## 0.20.3 (2024-04-22)

 - New `dropdown` row-level property in the [`form` component](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=form#component)
   - ![select dropdown in form](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/5a2268d3-4996-49c9-9fb5-d310e753f844)
   - ![multiselect input](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/e8d62d1a-c851-4fef-8c5c-a22991ffadcf)
 - Adds a new [`sqlpage.fetch`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=fetch#function) function that allows sending http requests from SQLPage. This is useful to query external APIs. This avoids having to resort to `sqlpage.exec`.
 - Fixed a bug that occured when using both HTTP and HTTPS in the same SQLPage instance. SQLPage tried to bind to the same (HTTP)
   port twice instead of binding to the HTTPS port. This is now fixed, and SQLPage can now be used with both a non-443 `port` and
   an `https_domain` set in the configuration file.
 - [Updated sqlparser](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
   - adds support for named windows in window functions
 - New icons with tabler icons 3.2: https://tabler.io/icons/changelog
 - Optimize queries like `select 'xxx' as component, sqlpage.some_function(...) as parameter`
   to avoid making an unneeded database query. 
   This is especially important for the performance of `sqlpage.run_sql` and the `dynamic` component.

## 0.20.2 (2024-04-01)

 - the **default component**, used when no `select '...' as component` is present, is now [table](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=table#component). It used to be the `debug` component instead. `table` makes it extremely easy to display the results of any SQL query in a readable manner. Just write any query in a `.sql` file open it in your browser, and you will see the results displayed in a table, without having to use any SQLPage-specific column names or attributes.
 - Better error messages when a [custom component](https://sql.ophir.dev/custom_components.sql) contains a syntax error. [Fix contributed upstream](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust/pull/638)
 - Lift a limitation on **sqlpage function nesting**. In previous versions, some sqlpage functions could not be used inside other sqlpage functions. For instance, `sqlpage.url_encode(sqlpage.exec('my_program'))` used to throw an error saying `Nested exec() function not allowed`. This limitation is now lifted, and you can nest any sqlpage function inside any other sqlpage function.
 - Allow **string concatenation in inside sqlpage function parameters**. For instance, `sqlpage.exec('echo', 'Hello ' || 'world')` is now supported, whereas it used to throw an error saying `exec('echo', 'Hello ' || 'world') is not a valid call. Only variables (such as $my_variable) and sqlpage function calls (such as sqlpage.header('my_header')) are supported as arguments to sqlpage functions.`.
 - Bump the minimal supported rust version to 1.77 (this is what allows us to easily handle nested sqlpage functions)

## 0.20.1 (2024-03-23)

 - More than 200 new icons, with [tabler icons v3](https://tabler.io/icons/changelog#3.0)
 - New [`sqlpage.persist_uploaded_file`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=persist_uploaded_file#function) function to save uploaded files to a permanent location on the local filesystem (where SQLPage is running). This is useful to store files uploaded by users in a safe location, and to serve them back to users later.
 - Correct error handling for file uploads. SQLPage used to silently ignore file uploads that failed (because they exceeded [max_uploaded_file_size](./configuration.md), for instance), but now it displays a clear error message to the user.

## 0.20.0 (2024-03-12)

 - **file inclusion**. This is a long awaited feature that allows you to include the contents of one file in another. This is useful to factorize common parts of your website, such as the header, or the authentication logic. There is a new [`sqlpage.run_sql`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=run_sql#function) function that runs a given SQL file and returns its result as a JSON array. Combined with the existing [`dynamic`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=dynamic#component) component, this allows you to include the content of a file in another, like this:
  ```sql
  select 'dynamic' as component, sqlpage.run_sql('header.sql') as properties;
  ```
 - **more powerful *dynamic* component**: the [`dynamic`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=dynamic#component) component can now be used to generate the special *header* components too, such as the `redirect`, `cookie`, `authentication`, `http_header` and `json` components. The *shell* component used to be allowed in dynamic components, but only if they were not nested (a dynamic component inside another one). This limitation is now lifted. This is particularly useful in combination with the new file inclusion feature, to factorize common parts of your website. There used to be a limited to how deeply nested dynamic components could be, but this limitation is now lifted too.
 - Add an `id` attribute to form fields in the [form](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=form#component) component. This allows you to easily reference form fields in custom javascript code.
 - New [`rss`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=rss#component) component to create RSS feeds, including **podcast feeds**. You can now create and manage your podcast feed entirely in SQL, and distribute it to all podcast directories such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.
 - Better error handling in template rendering. Many template helpers now display a more precise error message when they fail to execute. This makes it easier to debug errors when you [develop your own custom components](https://sql.ophir.dev/custom_components.sql).
 - better error messages when an error occurs when defining a variable with `SET`. SQLPage now displays the query that caused the error, and the name of the variable that was being defined.
 - Updated SQL parser to [v0.44](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0440-2024-03-02)
   - support [EXECUTE ... USING](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-statements.html#PLPGSQL-STATEMENTS-EXECUTING-DYN) in PostgreSQL
   - support `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... RETURNING`, which allows you to insert data into a table, and easily pass values from the inserted row to a SQLPage component. [postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/dml-returning.html), [mysql docs](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/insertreturning/), [sqlite docs](https://sqlite.org/lang_returning.html)
   - support [`UPDATE ... FROM`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_update.html#update_from) in SQLite
 - Bug fixes in charts. See [apexcharts.js v3.47.0](https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js/releases/tag/v3.47.0)

## 0.19.1 (2024-02-28)
  - **SECURITY**: fixes users being able to re-run migrations by visiting `/sqlpage/migrations/NNNN_name.sql` pages. If you are using sqlpage migrations, your migrations are not idempotent, and you use the default SQLPAGE_WEB_ROOT (`./`) and `SQLPAGE_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY` (`./sqlpage/`), you should upgrade to this version as soon as possible. If you are using a custom `SQLPAGE_WEB_ROOT` or `SQLPAGE_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY` or your migrations are idempotent, you can upgrade at your convenience.
 - Better error messages on invalid database connection strings. SQLPage now displays a more precise and useful message when an error occurs instead of a "panic" message.

## 0.19.0 (2024-02-25)

 - New `SQLPAGE_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY` environment variable to set the configuration directory from the environment.
   The configuration directory is where SQLPage looks for the `sqlpage.json` configuration file, for the `migrations` and `templates` directories, and the `on_connect.sql` file. It used to be hardcoded to `./sqlpage/`, which made each SQLPage invokation dependent on the [current working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory).
   Now you can, for instance, set `SQLPAGE_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY=/etc/sqlpage/` in your environment, and SQLPage will look for its configuration files in `/etc/sqlpage`, which is a more standard location for configuration files in a Unix environment.
     - The official docker image now sets `SQLPAGE_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY=/etc/sqlpage/` by default, and changes the working directory to `/var/www/` by default.
         - **⚠️ WARNING**: This change can break your docker image if you relied on setting the working directory to `/var/www` and putting the configuration in `/var/www/sqlpage`. In this case, the recommended setup is to store your sqlpage configuration directory and sql files in different directory. For more information see [this issue](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/246).
 - Updated the chart component to use the latest version of the charting library
   - https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js/releases/tag/v3.45.2
   - https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js/releases/tag/v3.46.0
 - Updated Tabler Icon library to v2.47 with new icons
   - see: https://tabler.io/icons/changelog ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFUiJa_WsAAd0Td?format=jpg&name=medium)
 - Added `prefix`, `prefix_icon` and `suffix` attributes to the `form` component to create input groups. Useful to add a currency symbol or a unit to a form input, or to visually illustrate the type of input expected.
 - Added `striped_rows`, `striped_columns`, `hover`,`border`, and `small` attributes to the [table component](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=table#component).
 - In the cookie component, set cookies for the entire website by default. The old behavior was to set the cookie
   only for files inside the current folder by default, which did not match the documentation, that says "If not specified, the cookie will be sent for all paths".
 - Dynamic components at the top of sql files.
   - If you have seen *Dynamic components at the top level are not supported, except for setting the shell component properties* in the past, you can now forget about it. You can now use dynamic components at the top level of your sql files, and they will be interpreted as expected.
 - [Custom shells](https://sql.ophir.dev/custom_components.sql):
    - It has always been possible to change the default shell of a SQLPage website by writing a `sqlpage/shell.handlebars` file. But that forced you to have a single shell for the whole website. It is now possible to have multiple shells, just by creating multiple `shell-*.handlebars` files in the `sqlpage` directory. A `shell-empty` file is also provided by default, to create pages without a shell (useful for returning non-html content, such as an RSS feed).
 - New `edit_link`, `delete_link`, and `view_link` row-level attributes in the list component to add icons and links to each row.
   - ![screenshot](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/df085592-8359-4fed-9aeb-27a2416ab6b8)
 - **Multiple page layouts** : The page layout is now configurable from the [shell component](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=shell#component). 3 layouts are available: `boxed` (the default), `fluid` (full width), and `horizontal` (with boxed contents but a full-width header).
   - ![horizontal layout screenshot](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/assets/552629/3c0fde36-7bf6-414e-b96f-c8880a2fc786)

## 0.18.3 (2024-02-03)

 - Updated dependencies
   - Updated sql parser, to add [support for new syntax](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), including:
     - MySQL's [`JSON_TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-table-functions.html) table-valued function, that allows easily iterating over json structures
     - MySQL's [`CALL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/call.html) statements, to call stored procedures.
     - PostgreSQL `^@` starts-with operator
 - New [carousel](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=carousel#component) component to display a carousel of images.
 - For those who write [custom components](https://sql.ophir.dev/custom_components.sql), a new `@component_index` variable is available in templates to get the index of the current component in the page. This makes it easy to generate unique ids for components.

## 0.18.2 (2024-01-29)

 - Completes the 0.18.1 fix for the `chart` component: fix missing chart title.

## 0.18.1 (2024-01-28)

 - Fixes a bug introduced in 0.18.0 where the `chart` component would not respect its `height` attribute.

## 0.18.0 (2024-01-28)

 - Fix small display issue on cards without a title.
 - New component: [`tracking`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=tracking#component) for beautiful and compact status reports.
 - New component: [`divider`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=divider#component) to add a horizontal line between other components.
 - New component: [`breadcrumb`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=breadcrumb#component) to display a breadcrumb navigation bar.
 - fixed a small visual bug in the `card` component, where the margin below footer text was too large.
 - new `ystep` top-level attribute in the `chart` component to customize the y-axis step size.
 - Updated default graph colors so that all series are easily distinguishable even when a large number of series are displayed.
 - New `embed` attribute in the `card` component that lets you build multi-column layouts of various components with cards.
  - ![](./examples/cards-with-remote-content/screenshot.png)
  - Added `id` and `class` attributes to all components, to make it easier to style them with custom CSS and to reference them in intra-page links and custom javascript code.
 - Implemented [uploaded_file_mime_type](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=uploaded_file_mime_type#function)
 - Update the built-in SQLite database to version 3.45.0: https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_0.html
 - Add support for unicode in the built-in SQLite database. This includes the `lower` and `upper` functions, and the `NOCASE` collation.

## 0.17.1 (2023-12-10)

 - The previous version reduced log verbosity, but also removed the ability to see the HTTP requests in the logs.
   This is now fixed, and you can see the HTTP requests again. Logging is still less verbose than before, but you can enable debug logs by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `debug`, or to `sqlpage=debug` to only see SQLPage debug logs.
 - Better error message when failing to bind to a low port (<1024) on Linux. SQLPage now displays a message explaining how to allow SQLPage to bind to a low port.
 - When https_domain is set, but a port number different from 443 is set, SQLPage now starts both an HTTP and an HTTPS server.
 - Better error message when component order is invalid. SQLPage has "header" components, such as [redirect](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=redirect#component) and [cookie](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=cookie#component), that must be executed before the rest of the page. SQLPage now displays a clear error message when you try to use them after other components.
 - Fix 404 error not displaying. 404 responses were missing a content-type header, which made them invisible in the browser.
 - Add an `image_url` row-level attribute to the [datagrid](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=datagrid#component) component to display tiny avatar images in data grids.
 - change breakpoints in the [hero](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=hero#component) component to make it more responsive on middle-sized screens such as tablets or small laptops. This avoids the hero image taking up the whole screen on these devices.
 - add an `image_url` row-level attribute to the [list](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=list#component) component to display small images in lists.
 - Fix bad contrast in links in custom page footers.
 - Add a new [configuration option](./configuration.md): `environment`. This allows you to set the environment in which SQLPage is running. It can be either `development` or `production`. In `production` mode, SQLPage will hide error messages and stack traces from the user, and will cache sql files in memory to avoid reloading them from disk when under heavy load.
 - Add support for `selected` in multi-select inputs in the [form](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=form#component) component. This allows you to pre-select some options in a multi-select input.
 - New function: [`sqlpage.protocol`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=protocol#function) to get the protocol used to access the current page. This is useful to build links that point to your own site, and work both in http and https.
 - Add an example to the documentation showing how to create heatmaps with the [chart](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=chart#component) component.
 - 18 new icons available: https://tabler.io/icons/changelog#2.43
 - New top-level attributes for the [`datagrid`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=datagrid#component) component: `description`, `description_md` , `icon` , `image_url`.

## 0.17.0 (2023-11-28)

### Uploads

This release is all about a long awaited feature: file uploads.
Your SQLPage website can now accept file uploads from users, store them either in a directory or directly in a database table.

You can add a file upload button to a form with a simple 

```sql
select 'form' as component;
select 'user_file' as name, 'file' as type;
```

when received by the server, the file will be saved in a temporary directory (customizable with `TMPDIR` on linux). You can access the temporary file path with the new [`sqlpage.uploaded_file_path`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=uploaded_file_path#function) function.

You can then persist the upload as a permanent file on the server with the [`sqlpage.exec`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=exec#function) function:

```sql
set file_path = sqlpage.uploaded_file_path('user_file');
select sqlpage.exec('mv', $file_path, '/path/to/my/file');
```

or you can store it directly in a database table with the new [`sqlpage.read_file_as_data_url`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=read_file#function) and [`sqlpage.read_file_as_text`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=read_file#function) functions:

```sql
insert into files (content) values (sqlpage.read_file_as_data_url(sqlpage.uploaded_file_path('user_file')))
returning 'text' as component, 'Uploaded new file with id: ' || id as contents;
```

The maximum size of uploaded files is configurable with the [`max_uploaded_file_size`](./configuration.md) configuration parameter. By default, it is set to 5 MiB.

#### Parsing CSV files

SQLPage can also parse uploaded CSV files and insert them directly into a database table.
SQLPage re-uses PostgreSQL's [`COPY` syntax](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html)
to import the CSV file into the database.
When connected to a PostgreSQL database, SQLPage will use the native `COPY` statement,
for super fast and efficient on-database CSV parsing.
But it will also work with any other database as well, by
parsing the CSV locally and emulating the same behavior with simple `INSERT` statements.

`user_file_upload.sql` :
```sql
select 'form' as component, 'bulk_user_import.sql' as action;
select 'user_file' as name, 'file' as type, 'text/csv' as accept;
```

`bulk_user_import.sql` :
```sql
-- create a temporary table to preprocess the data
create temporary table if not exists csv_import(name text, age text);
delete from csv_import; -- empty the table
-- If you don't have any preprocessing to do, you can skip the temporary table and use the target table directly

copy csv_import(name, age) from 'user_file'
with (header true, delimiter ',', quote '"', null 'NaN'); -- all the options are optional
-- since header is true, the first line of the file will be used to find the "name" and "age" columns
-- if you don't have a header line, the first column in the CSV will be interpreted as the first column of the table, etc

-- run any preprocessing you want on the data here

-- insert the data into the users table
insert into users (name, email)
select upper(name), cast(email as int) from csv_import;
```

#### New functions

##### Handle uploaded files

 - [`sqlpage.uploaded_file_path`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=uploaded_file_path#function) to get the temprary local path of a file uploaded by the user. This path will be valid until the end of the current request, and will be located in a temporary directory (customizable with `TMPDIR`). You can use [`sqlpage.exec`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=exec#function) to operate on the file, for instance to move it to a permanent location.
 - [`sqlpage.uploaded_file_mime_type`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=uploaded_file_name#function) to get the type of file uploaded by the user. This is the MIME type of the file, such as `image/png` or `text/csv`. You can use this to easily check that the file is of the expected type before storing it.

 The new *Image gallery* example in the official repository shows how to use these functions to create a simple image gallery with user uploads.

##### Read files

These new functions are useful to read the content of a file uploaded by the user,
but can also be used to read any file on the server.

 - [`sqlpage.read_file_as_text`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=read_file#function) reads the contents of a file on the server and returns a text string.
 - [`sqlpage.read_file_as_data_url`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=read_file#function) reads the contents of a file on the server and returns a [data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs). This is useful to embed images directly in web pages, or make link

### HTTPS

This is the other big feature of this release: SQLPage now supports HTTPS !

And it does not require you to do a lot of manual configuration
that will compromise your security if you get it wrong,
like most other web servers do. You just give SQLPage your domain name,
and it will take care of the rest.

And while we're at it, SQLPage also supports HTTP/2, for even faster page loads.

To enable HTTPS, you need to buy a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name)
and make it point to the server where SQLPage is running.
Then set the `https_domain` configuration parameter to `yourdomain.com` in your [`sqlpage.json` configuration file](./configuration.md).

```json
{
  "https_domain": "my-cool-website.com"
}
```

That's it. No external tool to install, no certificate to generate, no configuration to tweak.
No need to restart SQLPage either, or to worry about renewing your certificate when it expires.
SQLPage will automatically request a certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) by default,
and does not even need to listen on port 80 to do so.

### SQL parser improvements

SQLPage needs to parse SQL queries to be able to bind the right parameters to them,
and to inject the results of built-in sqlpage functions in them.
The parser we user is very powerful and supports most SQL features,
but there are some edge cases where it fails to parse a query.
That's why we contribute to it a lot, and bring the latest version of the parser to SQLPage as soon as it is released.

#### JSON functions in MS SQL Server

SQLPage now supports the [`FOR JSON` syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/json/format-query-results-as-json-with-for-json-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=json-path) in MS SQL Server.

This unlocks a lot of new possibilities, that were previously only available in other databases.

This is particularly interesting to build complex menus with the `shell` component,
to build multiple-answer select inputs with the `form` component,
and to create JSON APIs.

#### Other sql syntax enhancements

 - SQLPage now supports the custom `CONVERT` expression syntax for MS SQL Server, and the one for MySQL.
 - SQLPage now supports the `VARCHAR(MAX)` type in MS SQL Server and uses it for all variables bound as parameters to your SQL queries (we used to use `VARCHAR(8000)` before).
 - `INSERT INTO ... DEFAULT VALUES ...` is now supported 

### Other news

 - Dates and timestamps returned from the database are now always formatted in ISO 8601 format, which is the standard format for dates in JSON. This makes it easier to use dates in SQLPage.
 - The `cookie` component now supports setting an explicit expiration date for cookies.
 - The `cookie` component now supports setting the `SameSite` attribute of cookies, and defaults to `SameSite=Strict` for all cookies. What this means in practice is that cookies set by SQLPage will not be sent to your website if the user is coming from another website. This prevents someone from tricking your users into executing SQLPage queries on your website by sending them a malicious link.
 - Bugfix: setting `min` or `max` to `0` in a number field in the `form` component now works as expected.
 - Added support for `.env` files to set SQLPage's [environment variables](./configuration.md#environment-variables).
 - Better responsive design in the card component. Up to 5 cards per line on large screens. The number of cards per line is still customizable with the `columns` attribute.
 - New icons: 
   - ![new icons in tabler 42](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/assets/1282324/00856af9-841d-4aa9-995d-121c7ddcc005)

## 0.16.1 (2023-11-22)

 - fix a bug where setting a variable to a non-string value would always set it to null
 - clearer debug logs (https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs/pull/92)
 - update compiler to rust 1.74
 - use user id and group id 1000 in docker image (this is the default user id in most linux distributions)

## 0.16.0 (2023-11-19)

 - Add special handling of hidden inputs in [forms](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=form#component). Hidden inputs are now completely invisible to the end user, facilitating the implementation of multi-step forms, csrf protaction, and other complex forms.
 - 36 new icons available 
   - https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/releases/tag/v2.40.0
   - https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/releases/tag/v2.41.0
 - Support multiple statements in [`on_connect.sql`](./configuration.md) in MySQL.
 - Randomize postgres prepared statement names to avoid name collisions. This should fix a bug where SQLPage would report errors like `prepared statement "sqlx_s_1" already exists` when using a connection pooler in front of a PostgreSQL database. It is still not recommended to use SQLPage with an external connection pooler (such as pgbouncer), because SQLPage already implements its own connection pool. If you really want to use a connection pooler, you should set the [`max_connections`](./configuration.md) configuration parameter to `1` to disable the connection pooling logic in SQLPage.
 - SQL statements are now prepared lazily right before their first execution, instead of all at once when a file is first loaded, which allows **referencing a temporary table created at the start of a file in a later statement** in the same file. This works by delegating statement preparation to the database interface library we use (sqlx). The logic of preparing statements and caching them for later reuse is now entirely delegated to sqlx. This also nicely simplifies the code and logic inside sqlpage itself, and should slightly improve performance and memory usage.
   - Creating temporary tables at the start of a file is a nice way to keep state between multiple statements in a single file, without having to use variables, which can contain only a single string value: 
     ```sql
      DROP VIEW IF EXISTS current_user;

      CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW current_user AS
      SELECT * FROM users
      INNER JOIN sessions ON sessions.user_id = users.id
      WHERE sessions.session_id = sqlpage.cookie('session_id');
      
      SELECT 'card' as component,
              'Welcome, ' || username as title
      FROM current_user;
      ```
 - Add support for resetting variables to a `NULL` value using `SET`. Previously, storing `NULL` in a variable would store the string `'null'` instead of the `NULL` value. This is now fixed.
    ```sql
    SET myvar = NULL;
    SELECT 'card' as component;
    SELECT $myvar IS NULL as title; -- this used to display false, it now displays true
    ```

## 0.15.2 (2023-11-12)

 - Several improvements were made to the **map** component
  - Fix a bug where the new geojson support in the map component would not work when the geojson was passed as a string. This impacted databases that do not support native json objects, such as SQLite.
  - Improve support for geojson points (in addition to polygons and lines) in the map component.
  - Add a new `size` parameter to the map component to set the size of markers.
  - Document the `height` parameter to customize the size of the map.
  - `tile_source` parameter to customize the map tiles, giving completely free control over the map appearance.
  - `attribution` parameter to customize or remove the small copyright information text box at the bottom of the map. 
  - Add the ability to customize top navigation links and to create submenus in the `shell` component.
    - Postgres example:
    ```sql
    select 
      'shell' as component,
      'SQLPage' as title,
      JSON('{ "link":"/", "title":"Home" }') as menu_item,
      JSON('{ "title":"Options", "submenu":[
          {"link":"1.sql","title":"Page 1"},
          {"link":"2.sql","title":"Page 2"}
      ]}') as menu_item;
    ```
    - *note*: this requires a database that supports json objects natively. If you are using SQLite, you can work around this limitation by using the `dynamic` component.
 - Updated the embedded database to [SQLite 3.44](https://antonz.org/sqlite-3-44/), which improves performance, compatibility with other databases, and brings new date formatting functions. The new `ORDER BY` clause in aggregate functions is not supported yet in SQLPage.

## 0.15.1 (2023-11-07)

 - Many improvements in the [`form`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=form#component) component
   - Multiple form fields can now be aligned on the same line using the `width` attribute.
   - A *reset* button can now be added to the form using the `reset` top-level attribute.
   - The *submit* button can now be customized, and can be removed completely, which is useful to create multiple submit buttons that submit the form to different targets.
 - Support non-string values in markdown fields. `NULL` values are now displayed as empty strings, numeric values are displayed as strings, booleans as `true` or `false`, and arrays as lines of text. This avoids the need to cast values to strings in SQL queries.
 - Revert a change introduced in v0.15.0:
    - Re-add the systematic `CAST(? AS TEXT)` around variables, which helps the database know which type it is dealing with in advance. This fixes a regression in 0.15 where some SQLite websites were broken because of missing affinity information. In SQLite `SELECT '1' = 1` returns `false` but `SELECT CAST('1' AS TEXT) = 1` returns `true`. This also fixes error messages like `could not determine data type of parameter $1` in PostgreSQL.
 - Fix a bug where [cookie](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=cookie#component) removal set the cookie value to the empty string instead of removing the cookie completely.
 - Support form submission using the [button](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=button#component) component using its new `form` property. This allows you to create a form with multiple submit buttons that submit the form to different targets.
 - Custom icons and colors for markers in the [map](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=map#component) component.
 - Add support for GeoJSON in the [map](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=map#component) component. This makes it much more generic and allows you to display any kind of geographic data, including areas, on a map very easily. This plays nicely with PostGIS and Spatialite which can return GeoJSON directly from SQL queries.

## 0.15.0 (2023-10-29)
 - New function: [`sqlpage.path`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=path#function) to get the path of the current page.
 - Add a new `align_right` attribute to the [table](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=table#component) component to align a column to the right.
 - Fix display of long titles in the shell component.
 - New [`sqlpage.variables`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=variables#function) function for easy handling of complex forms
    - `sqlpage.variables('get')` returns a json object containing all url parameters. Inside `/my_page.sql?x=1&y=2`, it returns the string `'{"x":"1","y":"2"}'`
    - `sqlpage.variables('post')` returns a json object containg all variables passed through a form. This makes it much easier to handle a form with a variable number of fields.
 - Remove systematic casting in SQL of all parameters to `TEXT`. The supported databases understand the type of the parameters natively.
  - Some advanced or database-specific SQL syntax that previously failed to parse inside SQLPage is now supported. See [updates in SQLParser](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#added)


## 0.14.0 (2023-10-19)

 - Better support for time series in the [chart](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=chart#component) component. You can now use the `time` top-attribute to display a time series chart
 with smart x-axis labels.
 - **New component**: [button](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=button#component). This allows you to create rows of buttons that allow navigation between pages.
 - Better error messages for Microsoft SQL Server. SQLPage now displays the line number of the error, which is especially useful for debugging long migration scripts.
 - Many improvements in the official website and the documentation.
    - Most notably, the documentation now has syntax highlighting on code blocks (using [prism](https://prismjs.com/) with a custom theme made for tabler). This also illustrates the usage of external javascript and css libraries in SQLPage. See [the shell component documentation](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=shell#component).
    - Better display of example queries in the documentation, with smart indentation that makes it easier to read.
 - Clarify some ambiguous error messages:
   - make it clearer whether the error comes from SQLPage or from the database
   - specific tokenization errors are now displayed as such

## 0.13.0 (2023-10-16)
 - New [timeline](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=timeline#component) component to display a timeline of events.
 - Add support for scatter and bubble plots in the chart component. See [the chart documentation](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=chart#component).
 - further improve debuggability with more precise error messages. In particular, it usd to be hard to debug errors in long migration scripts, because the line number and position was not displayed. This is now fixed.
 - Better logs on 404 errors. SQLPage used to log a message without the path of the file that was not found. This made it hard to debug 404 errors. This is now fixed.
 - Add a new `top_image` attribute to the [card](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=card#component) component to display an image at the top of the card. This makes it possible to create beautiful image galleries with SQLPage.
 - Updated dependencies, for bug fixes and performance improvements.
 - New icons (see https://tabler-icons.io/changelog)
 - When `NULL` is passed as an icon name, display no icon instead of raising an error.
 - Official docker image folder structure changed. The docker image now expects 
   - the SQLPage website (`.sql` files) to be in `/var/www/`, and
   - the SQLPage configuration folder to be in `/etc/sqlpage/`
    - the configuration file should be in `/etc/sqlpage/sqlpage.json`
    - the database file should be in `/etc/sqlpage/sqlpage.db`
    - custom templates should be in `/etc/sqlpage/templates/`
   - This configuration change concerns only the docker image. If you are using the sqlpage binary directly, nothing changes.

## 0.12.0 (2023-10-04)

 - **variables** . SQLPage now support setting and reusing variables between statements. This allows you to write more complex SQL queries, and to reuse the result of a query in multiple places.
   ```sql
   -- Set a variable
   SET person = (select username from users where id = $id);
   -- Use it in a query
   SELECT 'text' AS component, 'Hello ' || $person AS contents;
   ```
 - *asynchronous password hashing* . SQLPage used to block a request processing thread while hashing passwords. This could cause a denial of service if an attacker sent many requests to a page that used `sqlpage.hash_password()`
 (typically, the account creation page of your website).
  SQLPage now launches password hashing operations on a separate thread pool, and can continue processing other requests while waiting for passwords to be hashed.
 - Easier configuration for multiple menu items. Syntax like `SELECT 'shell' as component, '["page 1", "page 2"]' as menu_item'` now works as expected. See the new `sqlpage_shell` definition in [the small sql game example](./examples/corporate-conundrum/) and [this discussion](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/discussions/91).
 - New `sqlpage.exec` function to execute a command on the server. This allows you to run arbitrary code on the server, and use the result in your SQL queries. This can be used to make external API calls, send emails, or run any other code on the server.
  ```sql
  select 'card' as component;
  select value->>'name' as title, value->>'email' as description
  from json_each(sqlpage.exec('curl', 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'));
   ```

   This function is disabled by default for security reasons. To enable it, set the `allow_exec` configuration parameter to `true` in the [configuration](./configuration.md). Enabling it gives full access to the server to anyone who can write SQL queries on your website (this includes users with access to the local filesystem and users with write access to the `sqlpage_files` table on your database), so be careful !
 - New `sqlpage.url_encode` function to percent-encode URL parameters.
   ```sql
   select 'card' as component;
   select 'More...' as title, 'advanced_search.sql?query=' || sqlpage.url_encode($query)
   ```
 - Add the ability to run a sql script on each database connection before it is used,
   by simply creating `sqlpage/on_connect.sql` file. This has many interesting use cases:
     - allows you to set up your database connection with custom settings, such as `PRAGMA` in SQLite
     - set a custom `search_path`, `application_name` or other variables in PostgreSQL
     - create temporary tables that will be available to all SQLPage queries but will not be persisted in the database
     - [`ATTACH`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html) a database in SQLite to query multiple database files at once
 - Better error messages. SQLPage displays a more precise and useful message when an error occurs, and displays the position in the SQL statement where the error occured. Incorrect error messages on invalid migrations are also fixed.
 - We now distribute docker images from ARM too. Say hello to SQLPage on your Raspberry Pi and your Mac M1 !
 - Create the default SQLite database file in the "sqlpage" config directory instead of at the root of the web server by default. This makes it inaccessible from the web, which is a more secure default. If you want to keep the old behavior, set the `database_url` configuration parameter to `sqlite://sqlpage.db` in your [configuration](./configuration.md).
 - New `empty_title`, `empty_description`, and `empty_link` top-level attributes on the [`list`](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=list#component) component to customize the text displayed when the list is empty.

## 0.11.0 (2023-09-17)
 - Support for **environment variables** ! You can now read environment variables from sql code using `sqlpage.environment_variable('VAR_NAME')`.
 - Better support for connection options in mssql.
 - New icons (see https://tabler-icons.io/changelog)
 - New version of the CSS library (see https://preview.tabler.io/changelog.html)
 - configurable web root (see [configuration.md](./configuration.md))
 - new welcome message 
   - ```
      SQLPage is now running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/
      You can write your code in .sql files in /path/to/your/website/directory.
      ```
 - New `sqlpage.current_working_directory` function to get the [current working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) of the SQLPage process.
  - New `sqlpage.version` function to get the version of SQLPage.

## 0.10.3 (2023-09-14)

 - Update database drivers to the latest version.
   - Adds new connection string options for mssql, including `app_name` and `instance`.
     Set them with `DATABASE_URL=mssql://user:password@host:port/database?app_name=My%20App&instance=My%20Instance` 

## 0.10.2 (2023-09-04)

 - Fix a bug where the `map` component followed by another component would break the page layout.

## 0.10.1 (2023-08-27)
 - Update the SQL parser, with multiple fixes. See https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0370-2023-08-22
 - Display all parameters in the debug component (instead of only row-level parameters).
 - Update dashmap for better file lookup performance.
 - Fix table sorting.
 - Fix a bug with Basic Authentication.
   See [#72](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/pull/72). Thanks to @edgrip for the contribution !

## 0.10.0 (2023-08-20)

 - `.sql` files are now parsed in the dialect of the database they are executed against,
   instead of always being parsed as a "Generic" dialect.
   This allows using more database-specific features in SQLPage and avoids confusion.
   This should not change anything in most cases, but could break your web application
   if you were relying on an SQL dialect syntax that is not directly supported by your database,
   hence the major version change.
 - Added the ability to download chart data as SVG, PNG, and **CSV** using the new `toolbar` attribute of the `chart` component.
   This makes it easy to provide a large data set and allow users to download it as a CSV file from a nice UI.
   ```sql
   SELECT 'chart' as component, 1 as toolbar;
   SELECT quarter as label, sum(sales) as value FROM sales GROUP BY quarter;
   ```
 - Added a dark theme ! You can now choose between a light and a dark theme for your SQLPage website.
   Select the dark theme using the `theme` parameter of the `shell` component:
   ```sql
   SELECT 'shell' AS component, 'dark' AS theme;
   ```
   See https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/50
 - Fixed a bug where the default index page would be displayed when `index.sql` could not be loaded,
   instead of displaying an error page explaining the issue.
 - Improved the appearance of scrollbars. (Workaround for https://github.com/tabler/tabler/issues/1648).
   See https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/discussions/17
 - Create a single database connection by default when using `sqlite://:memory:` as the database URL.
   This makes it easier to use temporary tables and other connection-specific features.
 - When no component is selected, display data with the `debug` component by default.
   This makes any simple `SELECT` statement a valid SQLPage file.
   Before, data returned outside of a component would be ignored.
 - Improved error handling. SQLPage now displays a nice error page when an error occurs, even if it's at the top of the page.
   This makes it easier to debug SQLPage websites. Before, errors that occured before SQLPage had started to render the page would be displayed as a raw text error message without any styling.
 - Added the ability to retry database connections when they fail on startup.
   This makes it easier to start SQLPage concurrently with the database, and have it wait for the database to become available.
   See the [`database_connection_retries` and `database_connection_acquire_timeout_seconds` configuration parameter](./configuration.md).

## 0.9.5 (2023-08-12)

 - New `tab` component to create tabbed interfaces. See [the documentation](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=tab#component).
 - Many improvements in database drivers.
   - performance and numeric precision improvements,
   - multiple fixes around passing NUMERIC, DECIMAL, and JSON values to SQLPage.

## 0.9.4 (2023-08-04)

Small bugfix release

 - Fix a bug with simple queries (ones with only static values) that contained multiple repeated columns
   (such as `SELECT 'hello' AS menu_item, 'world' AS menu_item`). Only the last column would be taken into account.
   This could manifest as a bug where
     - only the last menu item in the shell component would be displayed,
     - only the last markdown column in a table would be interpreted as markdown,
     - only the last icon column in a table would be displayed as an icon.

## 0.9.3 (2023-08-03)

 - Icons are now loaded directly from the sqlpage binary instead of loading them from a CDN.
  This allows pages to load faster, and to get a better score on google's performance audits, potentially improving your position in search results.
    - This also makes it possible to host a SQLPage website on an intranet without access to the internet.
    - Fixes https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/37
 - store compressed frontend assets in the SQLPage binary:
    - smaller SQLPage binary
    - Faster page loads, less work on the server
 - Fix a bug where table search would fail to find a row if the search term contained some special characters.
    - Fixes https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/46
 - Split the charts javascript code from the rest of the frontend code, and load it only when necessary.
   This greatly diminishes the amount of js loaded by default, and achieves very good performance scores by default.
   SQLPage websites now load even faster, een on slow mobile connections.

## 0.9.2 (2023-08-01)

 - Added support for more SQL data types. This notably fixes an issue with the display of datetime columns in tables.
    - See: https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/41
 - Updated dependencies, better SQL drivers

## 0.9.1 (2023-07-30)

 - Fix issues with the new experimental mssql driver.

## 0.9.0 (2023-07-30)

 - Added a new `json` component, which allows building a JSON API entirely in SQL with SQLPage !
   Now creating an api over your database is as simple as `SELECT 'json' AS component, JSON_OBJECT('hello', 'world') AS contents`.
 - `SELECT` statements that contain only static values are now interpreted directly by SQLPage, and do not result in a database query. This greatly improves the performance of pages that contain many static elements.
 - Redirect index pages without a trailing slash to the same page with the trailing slash. This ensures that relative links work correctly, and gives each page a unique canonical URL. (For instance, if you have a file in `myfolder/index.sql`, then it will be accessible at `mysite.com/myfolder/` and `mysite.com/myfolder` will redirect to `mysite.com/myfolder/`).
 - Update the database drivers to the latest version, and switch to a fork of `sqlx`. This also updates the embedded version of SQLite to 3.41.2, with [many cool new features](https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html) such as:
   - better json support
   - better performance
 - Add experimental support for *Microsoft SQL Server*. If you have a SQL Server database lying around, please test it and report any issue you might encounter !

## 0.8.0 (2023-07-17)

 - Added a new [`sqlite_extensions` configuration parameter](./configuration.md) to load SQLite extensions. This allows many interesting use cases, such as 
      - [using spatialite to build a geographic data application](./examples/make%20a%20geographic%20data%20application%20using%20sqlite%20extensions/),
      - querying CSV data from SQLPage with [vsv](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/docs/vsv.md),
      - or building a search engine for your data with [FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html).
 - Breaking: change the order of priority for loading configuration parameters: the environment variables have priority over the configuration file. This makes it easier to tweak the configuration of a SQLPage website when deploying it.
 - Fix the default index page in MySQL. Fixes [#23](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/23).
 - Add a new [map](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=map#component) component to display a map with markers on it. Useful to display geographic data from PostGIS or Spatialite.
 - Add a new `icon` attribute to the [table](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=table#component) component to display icons in the table.
 - Fix `textarea` fields in the [form](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=table#component) component to display the provided `value` attribute. Thanks Frank for the contribution !
 - SQLPage now guarantees that a single web request will be handled by a single database connection. Previously, connections were repeatedly taken and put back to the connection pool between each statement, preventing the use of temporary tables, transactions, and other connection-specific features such as [`last_insert_rowid`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#last_insert_rowid). This makes it much easier to keep state between SQL statements in a single `.sql` file. Please report any performance regression you might encounter. See [the many-to-many relationship example](./examples/modeling%20a%20many%20to%20many%20relationship%20with%20a%20form/).
 - The [table](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=table#component) component now supports setting a custom background color, and a custom CSS class on a given table line.
 - New `checked` attribute for checkboxes and radio buttons. 

## 0.7.2 (2023-07-10)

### [SQL components](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql)

 - New [authentication](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=authentication#component) component to handle user authentication, and password checking
 - New [redirect](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=redirect#component) component to stop rendering the current page and redirect the user to another page.
 - The [debug](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=debug#component) component is now documented
 - Added properties to the [shell](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=shell#component) component:
    - `css` to add custom CSS to the page
    - `javascript` to add custom Javascript to the page. An example of [how to use it to integrate a react component](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/tree/main/examples/using%20react%20and%20other%20custom%20scripts%20and%20styles) is available.
    - `footer` to set a message in the footer of the page

### [SQLPage functions](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql)

 - New [`sqlpage.basic_auth_username`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=basic_auth_username#function) function to get the name of the user logged in with HTTP basic authentication
 - New [`sqlpage.basic_auth_password`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=basic_auth_password#function) function to get the password of the user logged in with HTTP basic authentication.
 - New [`sqlpage.hash_password`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=hash_password#function) function to hash a password with the same algorithm as the [authentication](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql?component=authentication#component) component uses.
 - New [`sqlpage.header`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=header#function) function to read an HTTP header from the request.
 - New [`sqlpage.random_string`](https://sql.ophir.dev/functions.sql?function=random_string#function) function to generate a random string. Useful to generate session ids.


### Bug fixes

 - Fix a bug where the page style would not load in pages that were not in the root directory: https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/19
 - Fix resources being served with the wrong content type
 - Fix compilation of SQLPage as an AWS lambda function
 - Fixed logging and display of errors, to make them more useful
